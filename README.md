- 👋 Hi, I’m @leftcoastsarah
- 👀 I’m interested in games, dogs, sewing, horseback riding, archery, reading, and early modern english rural communal practices
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: many things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games!
- 📫 How to reach me: honestly tweet me @leftcoastsarah or on reddit, I'm usually at work or watching after family stuff so not on discord or online as much as I'd like
